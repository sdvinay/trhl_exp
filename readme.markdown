This is a place for me to experiment with ideas for TRHL/leaguesite.

For now, I'm playing with UI ideas using dojo.

I might play with other UI frameworks, such as YUI or JQuery.

I am thinking of creating a REST data API for TRHL/leaguesite date.  The actual implementation could be via static files, or something on the server parsing the existing TRHL flat files, or a full database implementation.  It could even use a framework like Django.  But the interesting part is creating the REST API; that will decouple the client from the server, and I can futz around with both to my heart's content.
